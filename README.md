# Reign of Grelok

This is a small adventure game written in Ruby. It is a Ruby rewrite of [Fallout 3 Easter Egg](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Reign_of_Grelok). You play as Grognak, a mighty barbarian, and your goal is to put an end to the terrible reign of Grelok, an evil wizard.

It is best to run the game in ruby: `ruby grelok.exe` But if you are under Windows and don't have Ruby, you can use the all-in-one executable: `reign_of_grelok.exe`
