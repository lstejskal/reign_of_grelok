### TODO

* remove duplicated GameData

* create website for the game

* modify into gem, enable installation with binary executable
(drop or change the binary executable for windows - host somewhere?
on gem website)

* refactor line_pars: 
  * they should be always array
  * "rusty_sword" vs. "rusty sword" - pick one form and stick with it

* figure out how to use synonyms (use_gift_on_person == give_gift_to_person, etc)

*  make code centered around things, not around commands

* why isn't location a thing as well? (or rather a child of thing)
