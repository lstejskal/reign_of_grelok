You can't beat me!' and conjures army of demons at his side. Clouds cover the sky and start raining fire, demons scream and Grelok chants a terrible curse. You throw the sword into his wide-opened mouth and it makes his head explode. The daemons' army turn into stone. \nSuddenly sky is blue again and refreshing cold breeze returns back to the mountains. The flock of pitch-black ravens feasts on the Grelok's squishy remains.\n\nCongratulations, the victory is yours!\n\nTHE END\n\n"
